# todo app with add,delete,edit functionality

Make a simple todo app with reactJS, just need two features in the app 
1. To add/edit/delete a todo
2. To display a list all todo

Few things to keep in mind
When we add a todo, it should get added via the keyboards ENTER button as well, not just clicking on the add button.
If you know how to use localStorage and can persist todo so that when we refresh the page, all my todo lists are still there that would be great.
